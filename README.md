# Flockathon-utility
--------------
It is a Utility code for flockathon 


##### What it does
- Users populate the specific youtube channel with their own playlist.The objective of this code is to delete all playlist at midnight


##### Why a new Repo then ?
- This code needs another active dyno and heroku provides only one dynos for one app.So created 2 apps which are sharing a common postgresDB. 
  Also due to use of heroku cli had to create this 2 different git repositories
